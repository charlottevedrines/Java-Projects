The first project finds the local minimum of a polynomial function of order n using steepest gradient descent.

Steepest descent is a special case of gradient descent where the step length is chosen to minimize the objective function value. The step size chosen will significantly impact the perform of the algorithm. Therefore, this project will utilize three different methods to calculate the step size:
- Fixed step size
- Armijo line search
- Golden section search
  
Finally, each algorithm will be evaluated based on the three metrics: norm of the gradient, number of iterations needed and computation time needed to determine the best performer in each category and the overall best performer.

This project was given as an assignment in Professor Aleman's class at the University of Toronto.
